# Installation and recovery checks

Validated on Apple Silicon with Python 3.12. This is a fresh virtual environment
and isolated user-data check on an existing Mac, not a test on a second physical
Mac or a factory-reset machine.

## Installation

- Created a new virtual environment without system site packages.
- Installed `./image-kit` with pip build isolation and dependency resolution.
- `pip check` reported no broken requirements.
- Ran the toolkit from a separate copy without private configuration, history,
  model weights or experimental probes.
- Started the manager with an empty home/cache/data directory and a separate
  loopback port. The UI opened, reported an empty catalog and free memory, and
  did not launch inference or download weights.
- Both Python suites passed: 48 manager tests and 57 image-engine tests.
  JavaScript syntax and SSE parser checks passed too. Node is a development-test
  dependency; the browser UI requires no frontend build.

Text inference engines are installed separately. Image dependencies are pinned
at MLX 0.32.2 and MFLUX 0.20.0; no model weights are bundled.

## Failure and cancellation

Tests exercise real small subprocesses and local HTTP servers rather than GPU
models. They cover:

- An owned process ignoring both interrupt and terminate is killed and reaped.
  Recovered processes still require matching identity before any signal.
- A missing text-runtime executable reports failure. A later launch can retry,
  and a failed launch releases the manager's memory reservation when no workload
  remains.
- Chat cancellation interrupts a stalled stream and a request waiting for
  response headers. Its active-request count returns to zero; the next chat can
  start. Browser disconnect closes the upstream connection as well.
- Cancellation arriving before stream registration prevents inference from
  starting for that request identifier.
- A cancelled image is not reported as successful even if the worker exits zero
  and leaves an output file.
- Completed resident-series images remain available, previous watchers cannot
  overwrite a later job, and model release completes before terminal success.
- Restart recovery retains completed-series counts and marks the remaining queue
  interrupted, without automatically starting more work.
- Non-finite decoder output cannot replace an existing PNG or publish a new one.
  Finite output is saved atomically.

The queue is one sequential image series, not a scheduler for independent users
or parallel GPU workloads. A cancelled worker gets ten seconds after interrupt,
then five seconds after terminate, then kill. Session release first allows thirty
seconds for normal cleanup. Completed images and saved partial chat replies stay
in local history.

These changes do not alter weights, precision, seed, scheduler or denoising steps.
Published numerical parity and timing evidence remains in
[the acceleration report](acceleration.md). No new speedup percentage is claimed
from these lifecycle tests.

## Web-search validation

The optional search feature adds ten manager tests, bringing that suite to 58. Tests cover provider failure without a fabricated answer, unsafe source URLs, preserved history turns, worker cancellation and deadlines, streaming metadata and non-streaming responses. SSE parser checks cover search metadata as well as byte fragmentation and UTF-8. A live query returned five sources and a completed local-model answer with numbered references. An isolated UI replay of that live trace verified clickable sources, saved history and toggle restoration after reload.
